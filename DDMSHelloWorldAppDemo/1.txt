The Darling Data Management System's development process always starts with the
creation of an App Package.

App packages define the basic configuration of an App.

Once an App Package is defined, it can be used to make an instance of an App
based on the App Package's configuration.

Once an app has been made from an App Package it can be built to run on a domain.

Multiple Apps can be built to run on a single domain, and individual Apps can
be built to run on many domains.

When a user makes a Request to the domain of a website running on the Darling
Data Management System the first thing that happens is the Darling Data Management
System attempts to determine which Responses and GlobalResponses respond to the
current Request so the appropriate output can be served to the user.

Responses are used to group OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents together
whose output is intended to be shown in response to a specific Request to the
domain the App is running on, as opposed to GlobalResponses which are used to group
OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is intended to
be shown in response to a all Requests to the domain the App is running on.

Once the Darling Data Management System determines which Responses and GlobalResponses
respond to the current Request, the collective output of the OutputComponents and
DynamicOutputComponents assigned to each of the Responses and GlobalResponses that
respond to the current Request is shown to the user.

It is usually best to define the App's Responses and GlobalResponses first, this
will help to make the App's larger structure clear before other Components are
defined.

In this example, only one GlobalResponse will be defined.

3. Define a GlobalResponse for the HelloWorld App

   Run: vim "$HOME/HelloWorld/Responses.sh"

   Add: dsh -n GlobalResponse "${app_name}" HelloWorldResponse 0

The output of an App is defined using OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents.

OutputComponents are used to define an App's static output.

DynamicOutputComponents are used to define an App's dynamic output, this is output
generated by interpreting an assigned file that exists in either the Darling Data
Management System's SharedDynamicOutput directory, or the App's DynamicOutput
directory.

This file can be a plain text file, a PHP file, an html file, a json file, etc.

Note: Files that have the .php file extension will be interpreted as executable
PHP code, all other file types will be interpreted as plain text.

4. Define an OutputComponent for the HelloWorld App
   Run: vim "$HOME/HelloWorld/OutputComponents.sh"

   Add: dsh -n OutputComponent "${app_name}" HelloWorld OutputContainer 0 "Hello World"

   Add: dsh -a "${app_name}" HelloWorldResponse HelloWorld OutputContainer OutputComponent

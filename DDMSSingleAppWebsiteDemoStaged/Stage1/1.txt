PHP is most commonly used to develop websites. The Darling Data Management System
was designed with this in mind, and though it could be used for other purposes,
the most likely use case is web development.

The following example will demonstrate how to use a single App to generate an
entire website. This website will be very simple, just two unique pages, some
css styles, some javascript, and appropriate links to navigate the site.

Single App Site Pages:
1. Homepage: Show a welcome message.
2. Pictures: Show a simple image gallery that uses javascript for image selection.

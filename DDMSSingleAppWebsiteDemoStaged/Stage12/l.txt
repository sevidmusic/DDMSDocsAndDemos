App's can be built to run on one, or many domains.

While an App is in development it can be useful to be able to run an App on one
or more local domains.

PHP is a wonderful language, and provides a built in web server that can be used
as a simple local development server. More information about PHP's built in server
can be found at:
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php

dsh can be used to start a development server via PHP on a specific port on localhost:

Once started, the server can be reached from a web browser via http://localhost:PORT

7. Start a development server on localhost at port 8080

     dsh -s 8080

Development server will be reachable via http://localhost:8080

It is usually best to define the App's Responses and GlobalResponses first, this
will help to make the App's larger structure clear before other Components are
defined.

Responses are used to group together OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents
whose output should be displayed in response to a specific Request to the domain
the App is running on.

GlobalResponses are Responses, but instead of responding to specific Requests,
a GlobalResponse will respond to all Requests.

Responses and GlobalResponses are organized relative to each other by their positions.

If multiple Responses and GlobalResponses are assigned to the same position, they
will be served in the order that they are loaded from storage.

For example, if Responses Foo, Bar, and Baz are all assigned to position 0, and
Foo is loaded first, Bar is loaded second, and  Baz loaded third, then the
positions will be adjusted as follows:

Foo Position: 0
Bar Position: 0.1
Baz Position: 0.2

Responses and GlobalResponses are defined in the App Package's Responses.sh
configuration script.

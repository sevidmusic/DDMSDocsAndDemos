The Darling Data Management System's understanding of an App is based on the App's
data. An App's data consists of the App's source code, and the Darling Data Management
System Components that the App defines.

The Darling Data Managment System provides a number of Components that can be used
to to implement an App. Components are objects that conform to niche interfaces
that represent the various parts of an application.

Legos are a good analogy for Components, like legos, individual Components are
used together to implement a larger design. Also, like legos, Components can be
reused in various contexts to implement a variety of designs.

In this example a single App is going to generate a website.

To do this the App needs to define appropriate Components to represent the various
parts of the website.

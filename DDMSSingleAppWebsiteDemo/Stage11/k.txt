Once an App has been made via dsh --make-app, it can be built for one or more
domains via the dsh --build-app command.

By default dsh --build-app will build an App for the domain defined in the App's
Components.php file. This domain will have been set by dsh --make-app to the value
assigned to the domain variable defined in the relevant App Packages config.sh
configuration script.

It is safe to modify the domain defined in the App's Components.php file after
the App has been made, however, dsh --build-app takes an optional domain as the
second parameter, so there is really no need to modify the domain set in App's
Components.php file, instead just use dsh --build-app [APP_NAME] [DOMAIN] to
easily build the App for one or more domains.

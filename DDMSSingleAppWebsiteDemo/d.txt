The App Package in this example will define the following dynamic output files:

    HtmlHead.php
    MainMenu.html
    Homepage.php
    Pictures.html

These files need to be created in the App Package's DynamicOutput directory.

Important note about file references within dynamic output files:
    Sometimes is may be necessary to reference a file from within a dynamic output
    file, for example, an image, or a javascript file, or a css file etc. Always
    make sure those files exist and are accessible.

    Css and javascript files referenced within a dynamic output file should be placed
    in the App Package's css and javascript directories, respectively, so that dsh
    knows to include them with the files copied from the App Package to the App
    whenever an instance of the App is made via dsh --make-app. The one exception
    to this is if the referenced files are served form a CDN or other location
    outside of the Darling Data Management System.

The App Package in this example will define the following css file in the App
Package's css directory. This file will be referenced from a <link> tag defined
in the HtmlHead.php dynamic output file's content:

    styles.css

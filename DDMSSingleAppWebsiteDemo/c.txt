The final step is to create any dynamic output files referenced by the
DynamicOutputComponents defined by the App Package.

The Darling Data Management System expects dynamic output files to exist in one of
the directories at the following paths relative to the Darling Data Managements
System's directory:

    ./SharedDynamicOutput/
    ./Apps/APP_NAME/DynamicOutput/

Dynamic output files that are used by multiple App's should be placed in the Darling
Data Management System's SharedDynamicOutput directory. These dynamic output files
must be created and maintained manually since they are not related to a specific
App.

Dynamic output files that are used by a single App should be included in the
relevant App Package's DynamicOutput directory so they can be copied to the
App's DynamicOutput directory whenever the App Package is made into an App
via dsh --make-app.

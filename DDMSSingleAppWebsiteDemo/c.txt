The next step is to create any dynamic output files referenced by the
DynamicOutputComponents defined by the App Package.

The Darling Data Management System expects dynamic output files to exist
in either the relevant App's DynamicOutput directory, or the Darling Data
Management System's SharedDynamicOutput directory.

For example:
    /path/to/Darling/Data/Management/System/Apps/APP_NAME/DynamicOutput/DYNAMIC_OUTPUT_FILE
    or
    /path/to/Darling/Data/Management/System/SharedDynamicOutput/DYNAMIC_OUTPUT_FILE

Dynamic output files that are used by a single App should be defined in the
relevant App Package's DynamicOutput directory so that dsh can copy them to the
App's DynamicOutput directory whenever an instance of the App is made from the
App Package via dsh --make-app.

Dynamic output files that are used by multiple App's should be placed in the Darling
Data Management System's SharedDynamicOutput directory. These dynamic output files
must be created and maintained manually since they are not related to a specific
App.

If an App defines a dynamic output file that shares a name with a dynamic output
file defined in the SharedDynamicOutput directory, the  App's dynamic output file
will be used. If two App's define a dynamic output file with the same name the
first file found by the Darling Data Management System will be used.

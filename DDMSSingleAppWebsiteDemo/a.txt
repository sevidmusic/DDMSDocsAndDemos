The App in this example is going to generate a website, so the App's App Package
will need to define OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents for the site's
PHP, html, css, and javascript.

In order for these OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents to be served to a
user in response to an appropriate Request, they must be assigned to either a
Response that is assigned the relevant Request, or to a GlobalResponse.

It is important to understand that Responses and GlobalResponses are sorted
relative to each other by their assigned positions. Likewise, OutputComponents
and DynamicOutputComponents are also sorted relative to each other by their assigned
position within the context of the Response or GlobalResponse they are assigned to.

For example, say a single App is running on a domain, and it defines two GlobalResponses,
and 3 OutputComponents:

  GlobalResponse Foo at position 1 assigned two OutputComponents:
    Baz at position 0 with output "BazOutput"
    Bazzer at position 5 with output "--BazzerOutput--"

  GlobalResponse Bar, at position 0 assigned one OutputCompoent:
    Bazbiz at position 7 with output "<p>BazBizOutput<p>"

Then any Request to the domain the App is running on will produce
the following output to be interpreted by the web browser:

    <p>BazBizOutput</p>BazOutput--BazzerOutput--

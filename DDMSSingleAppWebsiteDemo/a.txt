The App in this example is going to generate a website, so the App will need to
define OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents for the sites html, css, and
javascript. In order for these OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponent to be
served to a user in response to an appropriate Request, they must be assigned to
an appropriate Response or GlobalResponse.

It is important to understand Responses and GlobalResponses are sorted relative
to each other by their assigned positions. Likewise, OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents
are also sorted relativeto each other by their assigned position within the context
of the Response or GlobalResponse they are assigned to. For example, say a single
App is running on a domain, and it defines two GlobalResponses, and 3 OutputComponents:

  GlobalResponse, Foo at position 1 assigned OutputComponents:
    Baz at position 0 with output "BazOutput"
    Bazzer at position 5 with output "--BazzerOutput--"

  GlobalResponse, Bar, at position 0 assigned OutputCompoent:
    Bazbiz at position 0 with output "<p>BazBizOutput<p>"

Then the output of any Request to the domain the App is running on will produce
the following output:

  BazOutput--BazzerOutput--<p>BazBizOutput</p>

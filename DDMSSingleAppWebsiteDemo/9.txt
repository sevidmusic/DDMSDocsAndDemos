Next, define the OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents for the website.

Before doing this it is important to understand how an App's output is served to
a user by the Darling Data Management System.

When a user makes a Request to the domain of a website running on the Darling
Data Management System the first thing that happens is a Router Component is used
to determine which Responses and GlobalResponses respond to the current Request.
These Responses and GlobalResponses may be defined by one, or many Apps running
on the same domain.

Then, the collective output of the OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents
assigned to each of the Responses and GlobalResponses that respond to the current
Request is shown to the user.

To put it very simply, the Darling Data Management System takes all of the output
from the relevant OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents and constructs a
string that is served to the user via the Darling Data Management System's index.php

OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents are defined in the App Package's
OutputComponents.sh configuration script.

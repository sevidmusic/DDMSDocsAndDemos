PHP is most commonly used to develop websites. The Darling Data Management System
was designed with this in mind, though it is not a web framework, it is just a
set of tools designed to aide in the developent process.

The following example will demonstrate how to use a single App to generate an
entire website. This website will be very simple, just two unique pages, some
css styles, some javascript, and appropriate links to navigate the site.

Pages:
1. Homepage: Show a welcome message.
2. Pictures: Show a simple image gallery that uses javascript to cycyle through
   the pictures.

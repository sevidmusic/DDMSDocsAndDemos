The following Component types will be used in this example:
Request                Represnts a url such as http://singleappsite.example/
                       Note: Requests can be used to represent any url, not just urls
                             relative to the App's domain. However, Responses and
                             GlobalResponses will only respond to Requests that represent
                             a url relative to the App's domain.

Response               Represents a response to a specific Request to the App's domain.
                       Responses are used to group OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents
                       together whose output is intended to be shown in response to a specific
                       Request to the App's domain.

GlobalResponse         Represents a response to all Requests relative to the App's domain.
                       Global Responses are used to group OutputComponents and
                       DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is intended to be
                       shown in response to a all Requests to the App's domain.

OutputComponent        Represents an App's static output.

DynamicOutputComponent Represents an App's dynamic output, this is output generated
                       by an assigned file that exists in either the Darling Data
                       Managment System's SharedDynamicOutput directory, or the
                       App's DynamicOutput directory.

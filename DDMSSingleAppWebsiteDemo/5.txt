The following Component types will be used in this example:

Request                Represents a url such as http://APP_DOMAIN/
                       Note: Requests can be used to represent any url, not just
                             urls relative to the domain the App is running on.

Response               Responses are used to group OutputComponents and
                       DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is
                       intended to be shown in response to a specific
                       Request to the domain the App is running on.

GlobalResponse         GlobalResponses are used to group OutputComponents and
                       DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is intended
                       to be shown in response to a all Requests to the domain
                       the App is running on.

OutputComponent        OutputComponents are used to define an App's static output.

DynamicOutputComponent DynamicOutputComponents are used to define an App's dynamic
                       output, this is output generated by interpreting an assigned
                       file that exists in either the Darling Data Management System's
                       SharedDynamicOutput directory, or the App's DynamicOutput directory.
                       This file can be a plain text file, a PHP file, an html file, a json
                       file, etc.
                       Note: Files that have the .php file extension will be
                             interpreted as executable PHP code, all other file
                             types will be interpreted as plain text.

The following Component types will be used in this example:

Request                Represents a url such as http://singleappsite.example/
                       Note: Requests can be used to represent any url, not just
                             urls relative to the domain the App is running on.

Response               Responses are used to group OutputComponents and
                       DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is
                       intended to be shown in response to a specific
                       Request to the domain the App is running on.

GlobalResponse         Global Responses are used to group OutputComponents and
                       DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is intended
                       to be shown in response to a all Requests to the domain
                       the App is running on.

OutputComponent        Represents an App's static output.

DynamicOutputComponent Represents an App's dynamic output, this is output generated
                       by interpreting an assigned file that exists in either the
                       Darling Data Management System's SharedDynamicOutput directory,
                       or the App's DynamicOutput directory. This file can be a plain
                       text file, a PHP file, an html file, a json file, etc.

The following Component types will be used in this example:
Request                Represnts a url such as http://singleappsite.example/
                       Note: Requests can be used to represent any url, not just
                             urls relative the domain the App is running on.

Response               Represents a response to a specific Request the domain
                       the App is running on. Responses are used to group OutputComponents
                       and DynamicOutputComponents together whose output is intended
                       to be shown in response to a specific Request the domain
                       the App is running on.

GlobalResponse         Represents a response to all Requests relative the domain
                       the App is running on. Global Responses are used to group
                       OutputComponents and DynamicOutputComponents together whose
                       output is intended to be shown in response to a all Requests
                       the domain the App is running on.

OutputComponent        Represents an App's static output.

DynamicOutputComponent Represents an App's dynamic output, this is output generated
                       by an assigned file that exists in either the Darling Data
                       Managment System's SharedDynamicOutput directory, or the
                       App's DynamicOutput directory.

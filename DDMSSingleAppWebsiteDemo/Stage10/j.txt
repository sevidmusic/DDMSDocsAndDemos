An instance of an App can be made from an App Package via the dsh --make-app command.

First, dsh --make-app will create a new instance of the App, via an internal call
to the dsh --new App command.

Then, it will copy the App Package's css, js, and DynamicOutput directories to
the new App.

Finally, it will run the App Package's Responses.sh, Requests.sh, and OutputComponents.sh
configuration scripts to create the PHP configuration files for the App's Components via
the dsh calls defined in the App Package's Responses.sh, Requests.sh, and OutputComponents.sh
configuration scripts.

     dsh -m "$HOME/SingleAppWebsite"

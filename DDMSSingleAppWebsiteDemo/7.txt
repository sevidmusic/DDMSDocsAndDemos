In this example, two Responses will be defined, one for the Homepage, and one for
the Pictures page.

Additionally, three GlobalResponses will be defined, one for the opening html, one
for the main menu, and one for the closing html.

3. Define the App's Responses and GlobalResponses:

   Run: vim "$HOME/SingleAppWebsite/Responses.sh"

   Add: dsh -n GlobalResponse "${app_name}" OpeningHtml 0

   Add: dsh -n GlobalResponse "${app_name}" MainMenu 1

   Add: dsh -n GlobalResponse "${app_name}" ClosingHtml 999999999999999

   Add: dsh -n Response "${app_name}" Homepage 2

   Add: dsh -n Response "${app_name}" Pictures 2

Note: The position of the ClosingHtml GlobalResponse is set to high value to
      try and insure that it will always be served last, though this App is
      small now, it may grow, and it is also possible that other App's may
      be run on the same domain in the future. Setting a high value for Responses
      and GlobalResponse that should always be served last is good practice.

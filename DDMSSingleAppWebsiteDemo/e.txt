6. Define the App's dynamic output files in the App Package's DynamicOutput directory:
   Note: Make sure to also create any css or js files referenced in any html defined in
         the dynamic output files. Css files should be placed in the App Package's css
         directory, js files should be placed in the App Package's js directory.

6.a Create DynamicOutput/HtmlHead.php:
    Run: vim "$HOME/SingleAppWebsite/DynamicOutput/HtmlHead.php"
    Add:
    <head>
        <title>Single App Website Demo | <?php echo date(); ?></title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="description" content="Darling Data Management System">
        <meta name="keywords" content="Darling Data Management System, dsh, demos, documentation">
        <meta name="author" content="Sevi Donnelly Foreman">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <link href="./Apps/SingleAppWebsite/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>

Note: The HtmlHead.php file's content contains a <link> tag that references a
      css file, styles.css that is expected to exist in the App's css directory
      when the App is run on a domain. This css file must be created in the App
      Package's css directory in order for dsh to know to include it the files
      copied from the App Package to the App whenever dsh --make-app is run to
      make an instance of the App.

6.a.1 Create css/styles.css:
      body {  background: #000000; color: #ddf1ff; } /** Additional styles... */

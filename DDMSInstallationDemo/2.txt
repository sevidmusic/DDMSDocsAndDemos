The Darling Data Management System comes with three command line utilities:
dsh     (required): Used frequently for development with the Darling Data Management System.
dshUI   (required): Required by dsh, it is the back end of dsh's user interface.
dshUnit (optional) : *

dsh and dshUI MUST be in your $PATH or they will not work properly.

* dshUnit is not required for development with the Darling Data Management System,
  or by dsh. dshUnit is a bash unit testing framework that is used to develop and
  test dsh. Unless you are planning on modifying dsh's source code then you don't
  need dshUnit. However, dshUnit can be used on it's own as a bash unit testing
  framework. If you write a lot of bash, you may find dshUnit useful.

Again, make sure to at least ADD dsh AND dshUI TO YOUR $PATH!
If you would like to try dshUnit, add it as well.

Finally, please note that dsh, dshUI, and dshUnit are not required on production
installation of the Darling Data Management System, in fact, for security,
they should probably not be included in production installation!
